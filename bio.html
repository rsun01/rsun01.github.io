		I'm a current sophomore at Tufts University and I'm majoring in biology. I like cats even though I'm allergic to them. I only have a half birthday once every four years (can you figure out what my birthday is?). I like baths more than showers. I'm terrible at chess. I'm learning how to make websites!
